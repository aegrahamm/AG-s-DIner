      <h2>ABOUT THE OWNER</h2>
      <h3>Anna Graham</h3>
      <img src="file:///Users/annagraham/Desktop/IMG_0893.JPG">
      <p>Anna had a love for everything 50’s-70’s styled. She had a plan to create an environment that took you to a different time era while delivering America’s classic food. She envisioned a plan of creating an old-style diner in the modern world. She opened the restaurant in 2002 by learning how to run her own business after watching her father do the same thing her entire life. She is now happily married, with two little boys and a puppy. </p>
